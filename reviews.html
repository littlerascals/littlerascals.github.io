          <p>Michelle has taken excellent care of my pets for several years.
          They just love to see her coming through the door!  In the past I
          have trusted her with my elderly Rottie Lulu and Emma, a finicky
          calico kitty. Now she cares for my boxer Lady Bug who wags all over
          when she sees Michelle. Michelle is trustworthy, kind, and enjoys
          spending time with the animals that she cares for. I have total
          confidence that my favorite critters will be well attended when they
          are in Michelle's care.</p>

          <p>We have four cats, and we always worry about them when we leave
          town.  Now that we found Michelle and Little Rascals Pet Services, we
          know that our cats are in good hands when we are away.</p>

          <p>Michelle is reliable and makes scheduling very easy on us. She
          provides a daily update on each of the cats, which gives us peace of
          mind.</p>

          <p>She does such a good job, our cats seem like they barely notice we
          were ever gone.</p>

          <p>Last year, I adopted not one but two adorable orange tabby
          kittens. As a first time pet owner, there were a few anxieties and a
          lot of snuggles.  Luckily when I needed to find a pet sitter, I found
          Michelle. From the first meeting, all my worries about leaving were
          relieved. She is incredibly professional, organized, and friendly. I
          really appreciate her daily text messages that let me know that my
          apartment is still intact and my cats are getting a lot of love.
          Having her as a pet sitter makes planning vacations so much easier!
          I'd highly recommend her to anyone looking for a responsible,
          knowledge person to take care of their pets.</p>

          <p>Michelle and Little Rascals provided excellent care for our two
          dogs Jasmine and Bella.  We had to leave them for two weeks over the
          holidays, and while they're both comfortable in our home, we were
          comforted knowing that they had company three times every day.  They
          were happy and healthy when we returned, and we enjoyed the nightly
          text messages.  Michelle went above and beyond, helping us locate a
          smoke detector that was low on batteries (the dogs did not enjoy the
          chirping!), and helping out with other issues that cropped up around
          the house.  While our dogs will miss us next time we go out of town,
          I know they'll be in good hands with Little Rascals.</p>

          <p>I heartily recommend Little Rascals exceptional service! Michelle
          and I have known each other for several years; I trust her completely
          with my dog and my clients' pets.  In fact when I restricted my
          service area recently I was thrilled to be able to refer clients to
          her with confidence.  Michelle is knowledgeable, attentive and kind.
          Give her a call!</p>

          <p>I highly recommend Little Rascals Pet Services to anyone looking
          for a dependable and devoted pet care provider.  Michelle clearly
          loves animals and enjoys working with them, and she has done a
          wonderful of job caring for my cat, Lucy, while I'm out of town. I
          look forward to Michelle's reliable daily updates while I'm away, and
          Lucy is always healthy and happy when I return.  Knowing that
          Michelle is there gives me peace of mind while I'm traveling.</p>

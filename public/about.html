          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p>Thanks for visiting Little Rascals! My name is Michelle and I love
          animals! I know you probably aren't surprised to hear a pet sitter
          say that, but I wanted to say it anyway because I think it's
          important for you to know.  I feel so fortunate that I've been able
          to turn my passion into a career.  I've been working with animals
          professionally for several years now, first as a groomer for two of
          Austin's best known grooming shops and now as the owner of Little
          Rascals.</p>

          <p> In a prior life, I completed my masters in adult education from
          The University of Memphis and worked for several years in the field
          of international education before trading it all in for wet noses and
          wagging tails.  With the unique experience of having worked with
          people from all corners of the world and animals big and small, I've
          learned to be adaptable and flexible.  Along the way, I've also
          learned the value of professionalism.  I don't like cutting corners.
          I want you to simply get exactly what you expect and to feel
          confident leaving your pets in my care.</p>

<h1>About The Company</h1>
<p>Thanks for visiting Little Rascals! My name is Michelle and I
love animals! I know you probably aren't surprised to hear a pet
sitter say that, but I wanted to say it anyway because I think it's
important for you to know. As a pet parent myself, I know it can be
challenging to find just the right person to care for your pets
when you can't be there yourself. I personally have put off trips
because I didn't want to leave my pets behind. But sometimes, it
has to be done. Business trips have to be taken and quite frankly
so do vacations. I want you to feel happy and relaxed when you are
away knowing that your pets are being cared for.</p>
<p>I feel fortunate that I've been able to turn my passion into a
career. I've been working with animals professionally for several
years now, first as a groomer for two of Austin's best known
grooming shops and now as the owner of Little Rascals Pet Services.
I'm also a foster mom for Lil' Paws Rescue. And I even have two
very naughty dogs of my own; trust me I've seen it all! Soon, I
also hope to add a few chickens and maybe even a few pygmy goats to
the family (don't tell my husband).</p>
<p>In a prior life, I completed my masters in adult education from
The University of Memphis and worked for several years in the field
of international education before trading it all in for wet noses
and wagging tails.</p>
<p>With the unique experience of having worked with people from all
corners of the world and animals big and small, I have learned to
be adaptable and flexible. Along the way, I've also learned the
value of professionalism. I don't like cutting corners. I want you
to simply get exactly what you expect and to feel confident leaving
your pets in my care.</p>
<p>I'm really excited about working with you and your pets. Just
contact me, and we can talk about your needs.</p>

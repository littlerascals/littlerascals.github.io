<h1>Services</h1>
<h2>Dog Walking</h2>
<p>Walks include lots of fresh air, ground sniffing and of course
fresh water when we return home.</p>

<p>The rates above are for walking a single dog. Please contact me
for rates if you have more than one dog to walk.</p>
<p><em>Please note:</em> During the summer months, I only offer
daily walks during the morning hours. This is because the pavement
reaches temperatures many degrees hotter than the air temperature.
Dog pads are more sensitive than many people realize and walking a
dog during the hottest part of the day puts them at risk for burned
paw pads. In general, if it's too hot for you to walk barefoot,
it's too hot for your dog as well.</p>
<h2>Pet Sitting</h2>
<p>Visits include a potty break, feeding, administering medication
(as needed) and lots of love! I will also bring in the mail and
newspaper, water indoor plants, and rotate lights and shades to
give your house a lived-in feel.</p>

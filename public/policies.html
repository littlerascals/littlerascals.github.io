<h2>Request Service</h2>
<p>The easiest way to request service is to send an email to
<a href=
"mailto:michelle@littlerascalsaustin.com">michelle@littlerascalsaustin.com</a>
with your name, address, phone number, pet info and the dates of
service. Once your email is received, I'll give you a call to
either set up a meet and greet (if you are a new client) or to
discuss the details (if you are an existing client). New clients
please allow at least two weeks when scheduling appointments.
Existing clients please allow at least one weeks notice.</p>
<h2>Meet and Greet</h2>
<p>I require a face-to-face meeting with all new clients (human and
animal). Before the meeting, all required forms will be emailed to
you for you to complete. At the meet and greet, we will discuss the
services you require, your pet's routine, and go over any questions
you may have. This is also an important opportunity for your pet(s)
and I to get to know one another. At this time, I will also take
two copies of your house key and your deposit.</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>For pet sitting clients, a deposit of 50% is due when your keys
are picked up. The remainder is due once your keys are returned to
you after your trip.</p>
<p>For regular weekly walk clients, we can set up a payment
schedule.</p>
<h2>Cancellations</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, paid deposits are not refundable.</p>
<h2>Keys</h2>
<p>I require two sets of your house keys. Key pick-up is free if
given at the meet and greet. However, if a second trip is required
to pick up the keys, there will be a $10 charge.</p>
<p>Unlike most pet sitters, I do not keep your keys on file after
you return from your trip unless you are a frequent traveler. Once
you return from your trip, your keys will be returned to you. There
is no charge for key return.</p>
<h2>Upon your Return</h2>
<p>You must call or text to let me know you have returned home and
your pets are back in your care. Otherwise I will continue to visit
your pets as scheduled and you will be charged for those
visits.</p>
<h2>Vaccinations</h2>
<p>All pets must be current on vaccinations.</p>

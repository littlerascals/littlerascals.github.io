          <h1>Request Service</h1>

          <p>The easiest way to request service is to send an email to <a href=
            "mailto:michelle@littlerascalsaustin.com">michelle@littlerascalsaustin.com</a>
          with your name, address, phone number, pet info and the dates of
          service. Once your email is received, I'll give you a call to either
          set up a meet and greet (if you are a new client) or to discuss the
          details (if you are an existing client). New clients please allow at
          least two weeks when scheduling appointments.  Existing clients
          please allow at least one weeks notice.</p>

          <h1>Meet and Greet</h1>

          <p>I require a face-to-face meeting with all new clients (human and
          animal). Before the meeting, all required forms will be emailed to
          you for you to complete. At the meet and greet, we will discuss the
          services you require, your pet's routine, and go over any questions
          you may have. This is also an important opportunity for your pet(s)
          and I to get to know one another. At this time, I will also take two
          copies of your house key and your deposit.</p>

          <h1>Keys</h1>

          <p>I require two sets of your house keys. Key pick-up is free if
          given at the meet and greet. However, if a second trip is required to
          pick up the keys, there will be a $10 charge.</p> <p>Unlike most pet
          sitters, I do not keep your keys on file after you return from your
          trip unless you are a frequent traveler. Once you return from your
          trip, your keys will be returned to you. There is no charge for key
          return.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="box">

          <h1>Upon your Return</h1>

          <p>You must call or text to let me know you have returned home and
          your pets are back in your care. Otherwise I will continue to visit
          your pets as scheduled and you will be charged for those visits.</p>

          <h1>Payment</h1>

          <p>For pet sitting clients, a deposit of 50% is due when your keys
          are picked up. The remainder is due once your keys are returned to
          you after your trip.</p>

          <p>For regular weekly walk clients, we can set up a payment
          schedule.</p>

          <h1>Cancellations</h1>

          <p>Unfortunately, paid deposits are not refundable.</p>

          <h1>Vaccinations</h1>

          <p>All pets must be current on vaccinations.</p>
